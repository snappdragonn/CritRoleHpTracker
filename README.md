The data for each new campaign 3 episode is uploaded by about 24 hours after the end of the stream (Saturday 1:00am PT). Depending on how much combat there is in the episode and how soon I start working on it it could be sooner but probably not later. 

Campaign 2 is a work is progress and episode data will be uploaded by about 9:00pm wednesday Pacific Time each week
